      "\n",
      "4. **Thread Safety:** Since threads share the same memory space, caution must be exercised when accessing shared data to prevent race conditions. Race conditions occur when multiple threads attempt to access and modify shared resources simultaneously, potentially leading to unpredictable behavior.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Global Interpreter Lock (GIL):** The GIL in Python is a mutex that allows only one thread to execute Python bytecode at a time. This can limit the effectiveness of using threads for parallel processing in Python. As a result, Python threads may not be well-suited for CPU-bound tasks that require high levels of parallelism.\n",
      "\n",
      "While threads provide a means to introduce concurrency in a Python program, it is important to consider the limitations imposed by the GIL and design threads carefully to handle shared resources safely.
